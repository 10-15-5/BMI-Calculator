# BMI-Calculator

Takes in the user's name, height and weight (in either imperial or metric). 

Then displays their BMI, the result (underweight, healthy weight, overweight or obese), how muhc they need to lose/gain to be a healthy weight and their height and weight in both systems.

Then saves all the data to a CSV file, if one doesn't exist it will create one with the appropriate headers.
